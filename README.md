Hi,

I'm [Costas Kirgoussios](http://gr.linkedin.com/in/ckirgoussios/)

After giving 30 years of my life to IT, I guess I have the right to celebrate it by inviting to the party for the aenaon named "A must for every human". It will be a global party.

Please **Watch** this repo. Once the number of watchers reaches 100, I will post further info here.

Thanks

P.S. Sorry for the early entry but in this project all files require versioning.
